Seven different types of dry beans were used in this project, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. Use best machine learning algorithm to classify the most well-known 7 types of beans in Turkey; Barbunya, Bombay,Cali, Dermason, Horoz, Seker and Sira, depending only on dimension and shape features of bean varieties with no external discriminatory features. Data is already cleaned. Various plots such as scatter plots, violin plots, box plots, bar graphs etc. are plotted to explore the relationships between the output variable 'Class' and predictors. ML algorithms such as SVC , Decision Tree Classifier are used to predict the 'class'value . Accuracy of SVC model is 93% and Decision tree Regressor model is 89%.
